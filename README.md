# Crypto Checker

Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions. It has become a popular and innovative form of money that offers many advantages, such as decentralization, transparency, and anonymity. However, cryptocurrency also poses many challenges and risks, such as volatility, security, and regulation. Therefore, it is important for web developers and users to have access to reliable and up-to-date information on cryptocurrency, such as prices, trends, and news

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application that allows users to check the latest data on any cryptocurrency. The project is called Crypto Checker, and it uses React and APIs to create a user-friendly and responsive web interface. The project aims to solve the problem of finding and comparing cryptocurrency data from different sources and platforms. The project also aims to answer the question of how web developers can use React and APIs to create effective and engaging web applications that deal with cryptocurrency data.

# Getting Started with Crypto Checker

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the packages and libraries that are required to run the app

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5713](http://localhost:5713) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
